        Born and raised in Brazil, in a tropical state called Alagoas, I
        discovered a love for technology at young age, by playing with computer
        hardware. With years later I have delved into software development, and
        have challenged myself to develop many projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work developing universal web applications with Javascript
        and APIs with Elixir and Phoenix. I also love to play with
        docker-related projects.
      </p>
      <p>Presently I live in Orange County, and work on WeDeploy.</p>

        When Iâ€™m not at my computer, I love to travel and capture everything
        through my camera lens. Not looking to be a professional, but just
        another memory-lover who wants to remember how awesome life is.

        In my free time I try to learn different styles of dance, but my
        favorite style so far is Lindy Hop!
      </p>
      <p>Fun fact: My dog knows how to dance.</p>
