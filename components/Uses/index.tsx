        There&apos;s something magical about tools. Whether we&apos;re talking
        equipment for a hobby you practice or devices for your profession,
        researching and learning about new potential additions to our toolboxes
        is an important part of our development.

        Occasionally I&apos;ll get asked about the hardware or software I own
        and use. I decided to create a list of things that help me get stuff
        doneâ€”I&apos;ll keep this page updated as my setup changes.

        Most of these links are amazon affiliate links, so I&apos;ll support my
        passion for coffee and adventures if you buy through them.
