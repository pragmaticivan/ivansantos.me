          Born and raised in Brazil, in a tropical state called Alagoas, I discovered my love for technology at a young age. Years later, I have delved into software development and have challenged myself to develop many projects.

          I currently work developing universal web applications with Javascript and APIs with Go. I also love to play with docker-related projects.

        <p>Presently I live in Austin-TX and work for Everquote.</p>

          When I'm not at my computer, I love to travel and capture everything through my camera lens. Not looking to be a professional, but just another memory-lover who wants to remember how extraordinary life is.

          I've been adventuring with a few dance styles in my free time, but my favorite is Lindy Hop!

        <p>Fun fact: My dog knows how to dance.</p>
