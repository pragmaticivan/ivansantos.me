> How many professionals' influence has helped me become who I am today.

Many factors can influence how we overcome obstacles in our life. Such challenges typically happen when we face many uncertainties, providing us with choices that can change how our lives can be.

Many of our victories can be dedicated to all the mentors we have known throughout our lives, who have somehow helped us by guiding the path we have decided to pursue without asking for anything in return. Subliminally, with many times the desire to see you overcome your obstacles and walk a path to victory.

A simple gesture of effort to show how something works; a minute dedicated to suggesting something to read, an encouraging lecture to never give up, or even a piece of advice on avoiding some troubles can be something many of us can do.

## For those who don't know where to go, should any destination be good?

I remember just like it was yesterday, the day I got to play with my `first` computer. I've always been a curious guy, especially when it had to do with technology. My dad's friend helped me configure everything, and I started using/learning it all as much as possible.


For a long time, this friend helped us to format/install our computer when it was slow or abducted by víruses (LOL). That was the time I started thinking about doing that as a professional.

I learned with a friend the step-by-step of how to install and configure a computer, and it got me very interested in how everything worked. At eleven years old, I decided that I wanted to study way more than I was able at that time. Nothing is easy when you're a fellow who lives in a small city, which is also located in a small state. Believe it or not, I could find myself waiting until midnight to start using the internet with my Old fashion modem. I was the little IT kid in the block for many years, which never stopped me from having dreams about something more significant.


Sometimes I keep thinking about what would have happened If I hadn't met those people who certainly had a significant influence in my life to keep pursuing more knowledge. Have you stopped to think about what would *you* be without people like that in your life?


Nowadays, many people don't know what to do before starting a university degree. Usually, when they think about something, they are not really sure of what is the real meaning or what happens in a profession.

I have been influenced by people close to me, but not everyone is so lucky. I hope one day it will be better introduced in our education system.


## Sometimes, we just need a little push

They say that developers acquire what's called Impostor syndrome throughout their life. I can say that I had that even before I started. Even though people would say the opposite, I always thought anything I did was not good enough to show to someone. Many times, even close people would not appreciate it enough in many attempts.

In my university, sometimes we got the opportunity to attend some programming events, and that was when I met one of my old friends, `Juarez Filho`.

Maybe he doesn't know that until he reads this post, but my first programming internship had some contributions from his actions in my university. I remember being very insecure about participating in a CakePHP course because I was not feeling terrific about PHP and needed a little push (encouragement) to attend the class.

After this day, I never stopped. I've studied more and more and ended up getting two internships because of that workshop. Many people are responsible for many choices I took, many successful choices, but some very unfortunate. Even though, it certainly contributed to how I make my decisions, helping me improve the way I can think about situations and how to choose a good path for my life.

If we have more guides like those people, the community will provide better professionals with a better attitude. Attitudes can help other people with the "little push" they may need without expecting anything back. Something that, in the end, is extremely rewarding.

## If life gives you a lemon, make a caipirinha!

Nothing was easy; unfortunately, I was from another city, my internship was in the state capital, I had to move consequently, not knowing many people. Before that, I always had to go to college by bus, it was an average of 1 and a half hours to go and an hour and a half to get back, a lot to discourage.

I can say that one of the most decisive moments that totally contributed to my career was in my second internship. I was about seventeen, I think. The company owners (now friends) were at a level above the market. My internship assignment was not so trivial (haha). Stuff like: "Document this framework into object-oriented PHP in English, then create a template system in Smarty and generate the framework documentation."

Just imagine, I did not know any English, I was beginning to understand object orientation, and finally, Smarty was all in English and very complicated at the time. I felt pretty discouraged at the time.

I spent hours reading to "decipher" what I was doing wrong. I worked with maintenance and computer networks for a long time, so finally, I even thought about giving up programming because I thought I was terrible at it.

Luckily I was always mentored by the two partners of the company, which made me better understand the whole process and how to do each task. Finally, when I finished, I felt very happy. I never thought to do anything like this or work with a framework created by the company.

Sometimes I stop to think about what I would have done if my bosses had not helped me and understood I was having some trouble. Would I have continued with software development?

## Conferences, conferences, conferences, conferences!

"Dang! This person leaves their home so they can help folks in another city and does not get paid for it". I've heard a lot of people say that, sadly.

People need to learn the value they do not have by networking and listening to someone with experience speaking at events. Such people have gone through difficult times trying to solve a certain problem in a particular domain that will often save you from going down the same painful path.

In events, I met people who for many times contributed in a great way to the professional that I am today. And luckily, they got me some really nice jobs (hehe).

So get out of your comfort zone and invest in communication and learning, because if you are not seen, you are not remembered. Nothing will be easy if you don't leave your house to meet people and learn from all these experiences.

As one of the organizers of one of the biggest events in my state (Alagoas Dev Day), I know how difficult it is in Brazil to do something like this.

So when I know of some interesting event that fits in my pocket I always try to go. In the events that I attended I saw many opportunities to appear, I met extraordinary people and consequently many people sharing very interesting stories that surely would never know if I had stayed at home.

## Be a guide and help to create the next generation that will change the world

I'm happy for today (even with so many craps) programming communities have been growing a lot, and several mentors have been appearing every day. A simple gesture of help and guidance can contribute to a better career path for many people.

I try hard to contribute with career guidance from many friends and even in the life of those who have not yet decided what to do in life, showing at least what can happen if this person is in the programming area. Often with projects like the Remote Work Guide, or just with information on how I currently work.

Sporadically people just need that older brother's sermon to talk about what's wrong and how to get better. I feel that a lot of them have grown a lot like professionals after that and in a way, it's very gratifying for me.

It is quite clear that I will not be able to create a revolution yet, but I am doing my part. So if you know a little, or have enough experience to help someone, do not think too much help! The feeling you have of seeing someone you helped succeeding is indescribable. In a way, you are helping to create a new generation that will change the world!
